        <p>You feel cold.<br><br><br>A lot of time passes. Any coherent thoughts are impossible to form. You slowly dream to death.<br><br><br>Your death is suddenly interrupted. Consciousness floods your mind, filling it with alarm. You feel no sensations other than an unfamiliar energy, pulsating through your sentience.<br><br><br>You desperately reach into your memories. There are people, but the faces are blurred, their names unknowable. You had a life before this, but any recollection of it has deteriorated.<br><br><br>With a jolt, your sense of touch comes back to you. Dew covered grass itches your arms and legs as you feel a shirt dampen on your back.<br><br><br>You push yourself off the wet ground, sitting up blindly. A soft patter of rain is audible over the sounds of wind. Cool air pushes against your back, filling your clothes with a scent of the humid atmosphere.<br><br><br>Sight comes back slower, pulsating in and out with the energy in your head. Gradually your surroundings come into view.<br><br><br>A dense gray sky looms overhead, eclipsing the dark wasteland. Patches of yellow grass scatter the mute earth. Clouds of fog drift along the land.<br><br><br>A few meters away from you is an orange backpack, gathering spots from the occasional raindrop. You stand up.</p>
